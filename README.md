=============

#Backbone_Lite

The purpose of this project is to fully understand the functionality of front end javascript MVC frameworks... 
specifically Backbone in this case! 

I essentially just rebuilt many of the built in backbone.js methods from scratch (lots of handwritten ajax requests
and helper methods to render views!)
